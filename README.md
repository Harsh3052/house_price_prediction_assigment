## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 

- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Conclusions
- As we can see Lasso Regression R-Square is good on training data (93%) but it accuracy drops little on testing data (84%)..
- Compare to Lasso Regression Ridge's R-Square is little bit low (89%) but it's accuracy not dropped on testing data (86%) as compare to Lasso Regression
- In this scenario Ridge is performing ideal as it is well balanced between biased and varience.
